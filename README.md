To run the db :
- `$bundle install` to install ALL the gems
- `$rails db seed` to initialize a database
- `$rails console` to open the console (`$rc`if you're a hackerman)
- Try `$tp Doctor.all`, `$tp Patient.all`, `$tp Appointment.all` to check if everything works (it does)(well it did yesterday at least)
